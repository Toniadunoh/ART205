            Future Minds High School is based on a belief that free public
             education should be rich with exploration, discovery, and connections 
             to everyday life. Learning should connect the mind and heart of a child, 
             while also forming relevant applications to the world around them.

                Twenty years and four campuses later, we have 
                grown throughout the Greater Phoenix area. But we have 
                never outgrown this core belief.
            </p>
            <p>
                At each campus and in every classroom, caring and experienced 
                teachers help scholars learn to think critically and creatively. 
                An accelerated curriculum infuses traditional subjects with science, 
                technology, engineering, mathematics, music, philosophy, literature and language.
                 Through personalized learning and discovery, each child grows and thrives, becoming confident
                  and successful inside &horbar; and outside &horbar; the classroom.
